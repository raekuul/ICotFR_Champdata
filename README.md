# ICotFR_Champdata
Primarily these will be summaries and screenshots of champion upgrades.
Please take screenshots of the champion's upgrade tab while they're on the bench (to get the equipless values for upgrades)
Screenshots must be in PNG format
Branches only get folders if the upgrade trees are different (so Champion and Battle Master get separate folders, but Regis only gets one folder)
The upgrade tab must be complete within each folder (so there needs to be 0005 through 0150 for both Champion and Battle Master)
Update the TODO and run update-listing.bat whenever you add a branch
